Install

Remember install before try to use it application the Sqlite3 support to use the application
in 'development' or 'testing' mode. Of course you can change the database used going to change
in '/config/database.yml' if you want use another kind of database like MySql, Postgre or another.

If you got this using git into your rails web directory or your home directory

       user@host:~/ git clone git://github.com/cesarediaz/inventory.git my_inventory_application

Then in a command line you should go inside the 'my_inventory_application' .

       user@host:~/ cd my_inventory_application

and to start the application in development(for proves) state the next steps:

       user@host:~/ rake db:migrate VERSION=0

and then
       user@host:~/ rake db:migrate

and the next step is to load some basic data that could be used in development mode or just to
watch the application with some data

       user@host:~/ rake db:fixtures:load

and to watch in your local browser

       user@host:~/ script/server

and put in your local browser this

       http://127.0.0.1:3000 or http://localhost:3000


if you maybe want show this application from another places (your boss screen ;-) ) you need know the ip
address of your machine and put this for start the shared application:

       user@host:~/ script/server -b here_your_ip_address -p here_the_port_address

for example if your ip is 192.168.0.10 and the port is 3000 (or another port chose for you), well, you have
type something similar to the next

       user@host:~/ script/server -b  192.168.0.10 -p 3000

and in the remote browser of your 'client' put this

http://192.168.0.10:3000

and enjoy.


Then, if you would like deploy this application in production mode you can choose between different web servers.
