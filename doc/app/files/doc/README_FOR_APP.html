</p>
<p>
Remember install before try to use it application the Sqlite3 support to
use the application in &#8216;development&#8217; or &#8216;testing&#8217;
mode. Of course you can change the database used going to change in
&#8217;/config/database.yml&#8217; if you want use another kind of database
like MySql, Postgre or another.
</p>
<p>
If you got this using git into your rails web directory or your home
directory
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ git clone git://github.com/cesarediaz/inventory.git my_inventory_application
</pre>
<p>
Then in a command line you should go inside the
&#8216;my_inventory_application&#8217; .
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ cd my_inventory_application
</pre>
<p>
and to start the application in development(for proves) state the next
steps:
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ rake db:migrate VERSION=0
</pre>
<p>
and then
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ rake db:migrate
</pre>
<p>
and the next step is to load some basic data that could be used in
development mode or just to watch the application with some data
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ rake db:fixtures:load
</pre>
<p>
and to watch in your local browser
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ script/server
</pre>
<p>
and put in your local browser this
</p>
<pre>
       http://127.0.0.1:3000 or http://localhost:3000
</pre>
<p>
if you maybe want show this application from another places (your boss
screen ;-) ) you need know the ip address of your machine and put this for
start the shared application:
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ script/server -b here_your_ip_address -p here_the_port_address
</pre>
<p>
for example if your ip is 192.168.0.10 and the port is 3000 (or another
port chose for you), well, you have type something similar to the next
</p>
<pre>
       user@host:~/ script/server -b  192.168.0.10 -p 3000
</pre>
<p>
and in the remote browser of your &#8216;client&#8217; put this
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://192.168.0.10:3000">192.168.0.10:3000</a>
</p>
<p>
and enjoy.
</p>
